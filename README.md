# Advent of Code 2021-2023

My solutions for the 2021-2023 AOC tasks in Java

For the puzzle description and sample inputs, please refer to

Each packet (year) has its own main method. Just run the one that you are interested in.
The default configurations runs all days with a "reasonably short" execution time. Change the days/tasks/inputs variables in the
main method to run a specific task.

The individual puzzle inputs are deliberately not included from 2022 onwards. You can paste your own into the `LargeInputs` class.
